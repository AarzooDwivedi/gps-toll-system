# gps-toll-system

The GPS Toll System is a Python-based simulation designed to demonstrate how toll charges can be automated using GPS data. This project is particularly relevant for transportation and smart city applications, where traditional toll booths can be replaced with a more efficient, technology-driven solution.

Features
GPS-Based Tracking: Simulates vehicle movement using GPS coordinates.
Automated Toll Calculation: Calculates toll charges based on the distance traveled on toll roads.
Data Visualization: Visualizes vehicle routes and toll locations on a map using folium.
Modular Design: Organized code with clear separation of functionalities for easy maintenance and scalability.
